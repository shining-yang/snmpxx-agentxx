AGENT++ V4.x README
===================

Included within this package can be found the source code and examples
for AGENT++ 4.x for Linux, Solaris, Windows XP/7/8, Mac OS X, cygwin,
and many other operating systems (included embedded).
The following represents the directories which are included within the
compressed tar file and their contents.

For more details on the API, please refer to the API specification.

This library requires SNMP++v3.3 or later which can be obtained from
http://www.agentpp.com. SNMP++ up to 2.8 was designed by Peter Mellquist
(Hewlett Packard Co.) and was available from
http://rosegarden.external.hp.com/snmp++. This link no longer works
because HP discontinued SNMP++. You can download the patched version 2.8a
still from http://www.agentpp.com/snmp++v2.8a.tar.gz.

====================================================================

USAGE:

Note: If you are using autoconf, you can set the following as parameters
to the configure script. 

The AGENT++ lib (libagent++.[so|a]) should be compiled with 

-D_THREADS 

to enable the use of pthreads (multi-threading). This flag is defined
in agent++/include/agent++.h. You can undef it in order to build
a single threaded agent. Always include agent++.h in all your
source files to make sure that the lib and your code use the same
settings.

You only need to include "mib.h" to use the basic features of
AGENT++. If you want to use the logging mechanism of AGENT++ you have
to include "log.h" additionally. You can set the filter of the default
log by

	DefaultLog::log->set_filter(<logname>_LOG_IND, <level>);

and disable the logging at all by using the compiler switch -D_NO_LOGGING
which is recommended for best agent performance.
