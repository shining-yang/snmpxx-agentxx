README autoconf
===============

To use autoconf with SNMP++, execute the following 
commands in the "snmp++" directory:

autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If "autoreconf" fails you may try to update the provided
m4 scripts in the build-aux directory with:

autoreconf -i --force

The autoreconf process needs at least the following tools/libs:

autoconf
libtoolize
pkgconfig
openssl-devel | libdes | libtomcrypt  (required for SNMPv3 support)


The Makfile.<os-name> and common.mk files are no longer 
maintained but provided for reference for a minimal setup 
to ease porting SNMP++ to other platforms.
