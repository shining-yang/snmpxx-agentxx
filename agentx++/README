AgentX++ README
===============

AgentX++ is an implementation of the AgentX agent 
extensibility protocol, as described in RFC2741.

It has been tested against the UCD 4.1.2 master and subagent. 
The following problems with the UCD 4.1.2 release were found
during testing:

* The Opaque type handling by the UCD subagent.
* The UCD subagent does not handle search ranges correctly.
* The UCD master does not handle index allocation and
  row registration correctly (thus, shared tables should not
  be used with the UCD master).

Other inter operability testings have not been done yet.
