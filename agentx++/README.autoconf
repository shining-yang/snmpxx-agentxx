README autoconf
===============

To use autoconf with AgentX++, execute the following 
commands in the "agentX++" directory:

autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If "autoreconf" fails or prints warnings about newer *.m4 files
you may try to update the provided m4 scripts in the build-aux 
directory with:

autoreconf -i --force

The autoreconf process needs at least the following tools/libs:

autoconf
libtoolize
pkgconfig
openssl-devel | libdes | libtomcrypt  (required for SNMPv3 support)


The Makfile.<os-name> and common.mk files are no longer 
maintained but provided for reference for a minimal setup 
to ease porting AgentX++ to other platforms.

Autoconf & AgenPro Templates
----------------------------

If you have changed the module setup or compiling with the options
--with-agenpro-master or --with-agenpro-subagent for the first time
then you have to rerun "autoconf -i" in order to properly update the
Makefiles.
