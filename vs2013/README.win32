README WIN32
============

The Visual Studio 2013 project files require that the 
libdes, SNMP++, AGENT++, and/or AgentX++ sources
are extracted in the same directory as the Visual Studio
project files. The directory structure should then look
like (note: there must not be any version numbers in the
directory names):

common-root-dir
 |-- libdes
 |-- snmp++
 |-- agent++
 |-- agentx++
 |-- vs2013

Make sure, that you delete the file config_snmp_pp.h from
the snmp++\include\snmp_pp directory. Otherwise, the linked
programs crash on execution, because the different projects
might have used different versions of the config_snmp_pp.h
file.

The file with the right (default) settings for the WIN32 platform
is located in vs2013\SNMP++\include\snmp_pp and included from
there by the VS project files.

To build the libraries, use this order:

1. libdes (or openssh)
2. SNMP++
3. AGENT++
4. AgentX++
